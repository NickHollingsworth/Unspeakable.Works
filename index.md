# Welcome To Blogi

Blogi lets you make a website that works like a wiki, except:

* You dont need to install anything complex like a webserver.
* You dont have to create html or css or any other technical stuff.
* You dont have to learn how any programs work.

You just copy a couple of files to a free site like GitHub and you are off.

When you want to create a new page or add to an existing one you type them in normal english and they magically turn into web pages with headings and links and stuff.

It works for simple things. Here's a list of things still [link:todo].

And here some pages that have random [link:content] that are being used to check it works.
