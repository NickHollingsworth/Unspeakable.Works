# I'm a Lovely Heading One and Title.


## A Heading 2

Some text here. Very short.

This is a nice long paragraph. Its written as text on
an arbitrary number of lines
and it doesn't break until there is an blank line which separates the paragraphs. 
*Here's some italic stuff.*
Its still goings. There's loads of it. Here is more. |And more. When will it ever end? When there is a blank line between lines of text in the source file, that's when. Here it comes.

**About this** There. Now this is a new paragraph. This one is smaller.
*And this is italic.* But its also on a several lines of text in the source. 
And like the last paragraph they just get concatenated by the markdown to html conversion.
Neat!

I added this bit from github.com. Via chrome on the laptop.

And then I added this paragraph from an Android phone. This was by logging into GitHub and editing the markdown file directly.

Here is [link:content3] which I created entirely on the phone in GitHub.

This page doesnt exist but I want to add it: [link:content4].
