Diffentent RPGs are designed for different play experiences. Unspeakable aims for a very specific one:

Unspeakable is:

* In development: Theres nothing to play here yet.
* Tabletop RPG: Humans play it by talking to each other.
* Rules-Silent: Play sounds like an audio story or play unfolding. You cant hear the mechanics happening. They are unspoken. 
* Immersive: Lets players immerse into the experience of their characters.
* Uncertainty: Designed for mysteries, investigation, horror and the eeirie.  
* Focus on the fiction: Players engage with the unfolding story not the rules.
* Straight to play: No up-front character design or rule learning for players. Sit down and be playing in minutes.
